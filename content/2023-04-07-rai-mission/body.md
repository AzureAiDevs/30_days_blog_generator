## Why Responsible AI?

The article discusses Microsoft’s approach to artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment, which is guided by the principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability. Microsoft believes that AI is the defining technology of our time and is committed to developing and deploying AI technologies that benefit everyone across all organizations. The company has made huge investments in AI, integrating these technologies into its products and services, including Azure, Windows, Xbox, Teams, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Defender. The article also highlights the importance of developing and deploying AI responsibly and Microsoft’s practice of responsible AI by design. The company’s approach aims to ensure that responsible AI considerations are addressed at the earliest stages of system design and throughout the whole lifecycle, mitigating risks and securing the benefits of AI systems.

The article also discusses Microsoft’s approach to AI research, which involves advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific understanding into innovative technologies that create value for customers and benefit society. Microsoft’s researchers collaborate across disciplines, institutions, and geographies to deliver cutting-edge advances in vision, speech, language, decision-making, and machine learning. Recent efforts have focused on developing large-scale AI models that can process information in increasingly sophisticated ways and are more natural and intuitive to use. These efforts are made possible by advances in deep learning, coupled with internet-scale datasets and Microsoft Azure’s increasingly powerful AI supercomputing resources, making it possible to create AI models that perform a broad range of tasks across many different applications.
