## What's new in Copilot

GitHub has made updates to its AI-powered coding tool, Copilot, with the goal of improving code suggestions and responsiveness for developers. The underlying Codex model has been updated to deliver better results for code synthesis and the Fill-In-the-Middle paradigm has been introduced for better prompts for code suggestions. The extension for Visual Studio Code has also been updated with a lightweight client-side model that reduces unwanted suggestions and improves acceptance rates.

Additionally, an AI-based vulnerability prevention system has been introduced to identify and block insecure coding patterns in real-time. The system uses language models to quickly detect vulnerable patterns, including hardcoded credentials and SQL injections, even in incomplete code fragments. Vulnerable code suggestions are replaced with alternative suggestions.

These updates are available on Copilot for Individuals and Copilot for Business and GitHub aims to continue enhancing the developer experience. These updates will help developers code faster and more accurately while improving the security of their code.
