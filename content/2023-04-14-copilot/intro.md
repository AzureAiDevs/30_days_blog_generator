GitHub has improved its AI tool, Copilot, with updated Codex model and Fill-In-the-Middle prompts for code suggestions, as well as a new lightweight client-side model for the VS Code extension. Additionally, they have introduced an AI-based system for preventing vulnerabilities in code that quickly detects insecure coding patterns and provides alternative suggestions. These updates are available to both individual and business users of Copilot and aim to improve the coding speed, accuracy, and security for developers.
