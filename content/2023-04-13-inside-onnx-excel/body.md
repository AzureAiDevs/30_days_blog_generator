The article "Building an Excel Add-in with BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime" describes how to build an Excel add-in that uses BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime to perform natural language processing tasks within an Excel spreadsheet.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained natural language processing model developed by Google. It is designed to understand the context and meaning of words in text by analyzing the relationships between them. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer-based architecture, which allows it to analyze the entire sentence or paragraph at once, rather than processing the words one by one.

The article explains how to use BERT-JS, which is a JavaScript implementation of BERT, to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition within an Excel spreadsheet. ONNX Runtime is used to optimize the performance of BERT-JS within the Excel add-in.

The article provides step-by-step instructions on how to build the Excel add-in, including how to install the necessary software, how to create the add-in project, and how to add BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime to the project. It also includes code examples and screenshots to help users follow along.

In summary, the article demonstrates how to use BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime to perform natural language processing tasks within an Excel spreadsheet. BERT is a pre-trained natural language processing model that uses a transformer-based architecture to analyze the context and meaning of words in text.
