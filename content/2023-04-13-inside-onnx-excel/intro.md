The article "Building an Excel Add-in with BERT-JS and ONNX Runtime" provides readers with a guide to creating an Excel add-in that can perform natural language processing tasks using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and ONNX Runtime. BERT is a deep learning model originally developed by Google that is designed to understand the context and meaning of words in text. BERT-JS, which is a JavaScript implementation of the BERT model, will be used to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition within an Excel spreadsheet. ONNX Runtime will be used to help optimize the performance of the add-in. The article includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and screenshots to help readers follow along.
