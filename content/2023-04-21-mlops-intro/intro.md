In this YouTube video titled "(204) Learn Live: Start the machine learning lifecycle with MLOps | CLL99", two Microsoft experts, Cassie and Corey, discuss MLOps and its significance in the machine learning lifecycle. They describe ML Ops as a solution to the problems that arise when working with machine learning, such as the need for standard repeatable processes, cross-team alignments, large amounts of resources, and the ability to audit and explain. They also introduce the Microsoft Learn platform, which provides free resources for learning about various technologies, including ML Ops. The video covers identifying the different steps of the ML lifecycle, creating and managing machine learning models with ML Ops, and monitoring models and responding to incidents. Throughout the session, the experts encourage viewers to ask questions and interact with the moderators in the chat.
