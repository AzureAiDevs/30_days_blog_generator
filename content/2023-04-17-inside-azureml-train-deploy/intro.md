Last week was for Azure AI App developers. This week, we switch gears and focus on Azure Machine Learning services for people building, deploying, and "productionalizing" ML models. If you're a Data Scientist, or an ML or MLOps engineer, then this week is for you. 

Today, learn about training and deploying machine learning models using Azure ML.
