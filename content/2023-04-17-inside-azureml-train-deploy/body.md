This article discusses how to train and deploy machine learning models using Azure ML. The article outlines the advantages of training and deploying models in the cloud, which include the ability to handle larger datasets and models and the ability to scale to many more inference requests. The article provides three ways to perform tasks using Azure ML: using the Azure ML CLI, the Python SDK, or the Studio UI. Two GitHub repositories are included to help readers train and deploy models using the Azure ML CLI and the Python SDK.

The article then shows how to run the training code and save the model using the open-source MLflow framework, which allows for easy visualization of metrics and testing of the trained model. The author also includes commands to invoke the trained model on the dev machine for testing purposes. The article uses the Fashion MNIST dataset as an example and recommends testing code on the development machine first to reduce overhead before moving to the cloud.
