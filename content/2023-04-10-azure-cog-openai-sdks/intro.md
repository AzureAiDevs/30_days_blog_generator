Last week was Azure AI fundamentals week, this week, we switch gears and focus on Azure AI App Developers. This week is for folk building intelligent apps that call Azure AI Services or incorporate AI models directly into apps. 

So what better place to start than an introduction to the Azure AI Hub where you'll find loads of samples for using the Azure AI Services SDKs. These samples are invaluable for getting started with Azure Cognitive Services and the Azure OpenAI Service.
