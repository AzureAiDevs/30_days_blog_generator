Last week was Azure AI fundamentals week, this week, we switch gears and focus on Azure AI App Developers. This week is for app developers building intelligent apps calling Azure AI Services or incorporating AI models directly into apps. 

So what better place to start than an introduction to the Azure AI Hub where you'll find loads of samples for using the Azure AI Services SDKs.
