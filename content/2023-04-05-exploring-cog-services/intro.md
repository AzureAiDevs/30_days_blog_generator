GitHub Copilot is a new tool that uses OpenAI Codex GPT-3 to help developers write code more efficiently and productively. By using natural language, developers can describe what they need to accomplish, and GitHub Copilot will translate that into code in different programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and more. In this session, we will explore how to use GitHub Copilot to solve business problems using the Azure Form Recognizer API to read the contents of a receipt in Python. The goal of this demonstration is to show how GitHub Copilot can make coding faster and easier.
