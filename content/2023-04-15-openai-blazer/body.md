Blazor is a new web framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) using .NET and C#. It allows developers to create client-side web applications with the same language and tools they use to build server-side applications. One of the benefits of Blazor is that it eliminates the need for JavaScript, which can often cause compatibility issues and make development more challenging. Blazor provides a more cohesive development experience, with full-stack web development using .NET.
