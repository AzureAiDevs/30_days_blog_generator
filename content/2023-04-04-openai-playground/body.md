## Getting started with the Azure OpenAI Service Playground

This article provides an overview of language models and hyperparameters, with a focus on conversational AI models from OpenAI. The article covers how to consume these models via API directly from OpenAI, as well as how to tune hyperparameters to tailor the models to specific use cases and needs. The author also provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an Azure OpenAI instance to access the OpenAI Playground for experimentation. The article examines the (hyper)parameters to be tuned, such as temperature, max length, stop sequences, top probabilities, frequency penalty, presence penalty, and best of. The article concludes by highlighting the three main categories of models offered by OpenAI: GPT-3, Codex, and Embeddings, and the different models available within each category.
